	Mr. Monkey woke up at 7am this morning.  He made himself a poppy seed bagel with creamcheese for breakfast, 
and then took a shower.  Millard Monkey knew that this would be a classy day, so he decided to wear his favorite fuzzy 
black tuxedo.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny red shoes on.  He grabbed his umbrella, just in case, and left 
through the front door.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant yellow tuba. 

Bananas are too generic. Something not really yellow is better fitting for the story. 
A tuxedo would be way classier than just an average suit
